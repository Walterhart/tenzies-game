# Tenzies Game

Welcome to the Tenzies game! Tenzies is a simple dice game where the objective is to roll all the dice and achieve a winning combination.

## How to Play

1. When you launch the game, you will be presented with a screen displaying the title "Tenzies" and a description of the game.

2. Below the description, you will find two rows of dice. Each dice represents a random value between 0 and 10.

3. To play, click on any dice to toggle its hold status. When a dice is held, its background color changes to a light green shade. You can hold as many dice as you want.

4. Click the "Roll" button to roll the non-held dice. The held dice will retain their values.

5. Continue rolling the dice and holding the ones you desire until you achieve a winning condition. The winning condition is when all the dice show the same value, and all dice are held.

6. Once you win the game, a message will appear saying "Congratulations! You won!". At this point, a "New Game" button will appear below the message.
